# disc-golf-scorecard

In this project I wanted to replace paper scorecards with something that I made 
myself. At first I made seperate files for html, css, js and json and I used Fetch API, 
but I found out that I wouldn't be able to use this website the way I wanted to. 
That is why I made scoretrackeraio.html (all in one) and got rid of Fetch.

This website is build to be used in a smartphone during a game of disc golf.
